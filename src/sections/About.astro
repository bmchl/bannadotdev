      my passion lies at the intersection of front-end development and meticulous ui/ux design. i thrive on crafting pixel-perfect interfaces where every element serves a purpose. this attention to detail extends beyond code—whether i'm designing a user flow or working on other creative projects, i find harmony in balancing technical precision with creative expression.

      beyond tech, i'm deeply invested in the wellness space, exploring how digital experiences can promote better health outcomes. music is a significant influence in my life—particularly pop and r&b—where i enjoy analyzing the technology that powers music production, publishing, and streaming platforms. this appreciation for different disciplines informs how i build technology that resonates on a human level.
